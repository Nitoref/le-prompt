#### Yet another one ?

This theme is for people that love their good ol' shell, or don't want/can switch to zsh - but still want a wonderfull looking shell like all the cool kids. It's also a theme for people that works in different environnements but want a unifying experience. Finally it's a prompt for you windows users.

[powerline-go](https://github.com/justjanne/powerline-go) is the closest project from this one, and has heavily influenced it. Other projects such as [powerlevel9k](https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k), [agnoster](https://github.com/agnoster/agnoster-zsh-theme) also inspired this software and helped writing the segments code. This project adresses some of these projects' drawbacks by providing better performance, wider shell support, right prompt support for each one, extensibility and a better configuration format.

Apart from lower lattency this theme also offers dynamic segment printing thanks to a shrinking system: instead of completely removing the right prompt when short in space, the least prioritized segments are removed until an acceptable length is reached.

No subprocess, no pipes to grep and perl, no hidden python interpreter, just plain C++.

#### Isn't it overkill ?

Indeed
